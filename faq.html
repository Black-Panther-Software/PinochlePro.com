                Pinochle Pro models a robust shuffling algorithm designed to mimic real-life card shuffling, ensuring fairness and unpredictability. While streaks of similar hands may occur occasionally, it's essential to recognize the extremely low probability of any two hands being exactly alike due to the vast number of possible combinations inherent in a shuffled deck of cards. With 48 cards in a Pinochle deck and over 3 x 10<sup>66</sup> possible permutations (that's 48 multiplied by 47, then by 46, and so on down to 1, known as 48 factorial), the chances of repeating a hand are infinitesimally small.
