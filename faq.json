        "question": "Why do I keep getting similar hands? Why is it not more random?",
        "answer": "Pinochle Pro models its shuffling algorithm designed to mimic real-life card shuffling, ensuring fairness and unpredictability. While streaks of similar hands may occur occasionally, it's essential to recognize the extremely low probability of any two hands being exactly alike due to the vast number of possible combinations inherent in a shuffled deck of cards. With 48 cards in a Pinochle deck and over 3 x 10<sup>66</sup> possible permutations (that's 48 multiplied by 47, then by 46, and so on down to 1, known as 48 factorial), the chances of repeating a hand are infinitesimally small.

        "question": "Is there a way to make by partner and opponents bid less aggressively?",
        "answer": "Pinochle Pro's bidding logic is modeled after how humans bid. Not knowing what it's partner will pass, players assesses how strong the hand is and considers the possibility that its partner may or may not pass the card(s) needed. Because Pinochle Pro players never cheat (by looking at other player‚Äôs hands) and the randomness of shuffled cards, players will bid too high and will go set!<br/>If you are finding your partner or opponents bidding too high or low, you can influence your partner and opponent's bidding styles in the game options<br/><ul><li><b>Conservative:<b/> The AI bids with approximately 85% accuracy, assuming receiving a single-card hit from their partner</li><li><b>Aggressive:<b/> The AI bids higher, maintaining approximately 70% accuracy, assuming receiving a single-card hit from their partner</li></ul>"
